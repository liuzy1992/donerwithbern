This paper aims to observe and analyze the safety and clinical efficacy of Fingolimod combined with alteplase intravenous thrombolysis in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. 90 patients with acute ischemic stroke were randomly divided into two groups. 45 patients in the control group were given alteplase intravenous thrombolysis for injection. 45 cases in the trial group were treated with Fingolimod combined with alteplase. There was no significant difference in NIHSS score, mRS score and BI index between the two groups 14 days after treatment, but 90 days after treatment, NIHSS score and mRS score of the experimental group were significantly lower than that of the control group, and BI index was significantly higher (P<0.05). 24 hours after oral administration of Fingolimod (0.5 mg), the circulating blood CD4 + T, CD8 + T, CD19 + B and CD56 + natural killer cells of the patients in the combined treatment group decreased steadily to varying degrees. The results confirm the pharmacological effect of Fingolimod: it changes lymphocyte migration, promotes lymphocyte to enter lymphoid tissue, prevents lymphocyte from leaving lymphoid tissue to enter the peripheral circulation, and thus prevents these immune cells from infiltrating the central nervous system. The results showed that Fingolimod combined with alteplase intravenous thrombolysis is safe for patients with acute ischemic stroke. .","denotations":[{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":12,"end":22},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["MESH:D020521","OMIM:606799","BERN:106966501"],"span":{"begin":50,"end":71},"obj":"disease"},{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":175,"end":185},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["MESH:D020521","OMIM:606799","BERN:106966501"],"span":{"begin":255,"end":276},"obj":"disease"},{"id":["MESH:D020521","OMIM:606799","BERN:106966501"],"span":{"begin":295,"end":316},"obj":"disease"},{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":496,"end":506},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":879,"end":889},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["MIM:186940","HGNC:1678","Ensembl:ENSG00000010610","BERN:325454802"],"span":{"begin":922,"end":927},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["BERN:326419602"],"span":{"begin":928,"end":929},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["MIM:186910","HGNC:1706","Ensembl:ENSG00000153563","BERN:325464002"],"span":{"begin":931,"end":936},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["BERN:326419602"],"span":{"begin":937,"end":938},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["MIM:107265","HGNC:1633","Ensembl:ENSG00000177455","BERN:325472302"],"span":{"begin":940,"end":946},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["MIM:116930","HGNC:7656","Ensembl:ENSG00000149294","BERN:324149202"],"span":{"begin":953,"end":959},"obj":"gene"},{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":1118,"end":1128},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["CHEBI:63112","BERN:4741103"],"span":{"begin":1402,"end":1412},"obj":"drug"},{"id":["MESH:D020521","OMIM:606799","BERN:106966501"],"span":{"begin":1488,"end":1509},"obj":"disease"}],"timestamp":"Wed Oct 28 07:07:33 +0000 2020","logits":{"disease":[[{"start":50,"end":71,"id":"MESH:D020521\tOMIM:606799\tBERN:106966501"},0.9999998211860657],[{"start":255,"end":276,"id":"MESH:D020521\tOMIM:606799\tBERN:106966501"},0.9999998211860657],[{"start":295,"end":316,"id":"MESH:D020521\tOMIM:606799\tBERN:106966501"},0.9999999403953552],[{"start":1488,"end":1509,"id":"MESH:D020521\tOMIM:606799\tBERN:106966501"},0.9999961853027344]],"gene":[[{"start":922,"end":927,"id":"MIM:186940\tHGNC:1678\tEnsembl:ENSG00000010610\tBERN:325454802"},0.9999967813491821],[{"start":928,"end":929,"id":"BERN:326419602"},0.9999533891677856],[{"start":931,"end":936,"id":"MIM:186910\tHGNC:1706\tEnsembl:ENSG00000153563\tBERN:325464002"},0.999996542930603],[{"start":937,"end":938,"id":"BERN:326419602"},0.9999545812606812],[{"start":940,"end":946,"id":"MIM:107265\tHGNC:1633\tEnsembl:ENSG00000177455\tBERN:325472302"},0.999996542930603],[{"start":953,"end":959,"id":"MIM:116930\tHGNC:7656\tEnsembl:ENSG00000149294\tBERN:324149202"},0.9999969005584717]],"drug":[[{"start":12,"end":22,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.999996542930603],[{"start":175,"end":185,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.999996542930603],[{"start":496,"end":506,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.9999953508377075],[{"start":879,"end":889,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.9999963045120239],[{"start":1118,"end":1128,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.9999955892562866],[{"start":1402,"end":1412,"id":"CHEBI:63112\tBERN:4741103"},0.9999960660934448]],"species":[[{"start":281,"end":289},0.9999998807907104],[{"start":359,"end":367},0.9999998807907104],[{"start":988,"end":996},0.9999998807907104],[{"start":1474,"end":1482},0.9999998807907104]]},"elapsed_time":{"tmtool":0.995,"ner":0.615,"normalization":0.267,"total":1.878}}]
